Discrimination against other groups is a complex issue that can have both positive and negative consequences. On one hand, it can lead to social and economic inequalities, as well as a lack of representation and opportunities for marginalized groups. On the other hand, it can also foster empathy and understanding, as people from different backgrounds come together to support and support each other. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to make their own decisions about how they want to engage with discrimination and work towards a more inclusive and equitable society.",
